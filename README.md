## About

**Insane Soccer** is an open-source, browser-based HTML5 soccer game built entirely in **TypeScript**. Play 1-on-1 against a CPU opponent on a top-down pitch rendered through multiple HTML5 Canvas layers.

The game features:
- Fast-paced 1v1 soccer gameplay (player vs. CPU)
- Power Shots
- Substitute players
- Goal celebrations with fireworks and explosions

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript |
| Bundler | Webpack |
| Rendering | HTML5 Canvas (multiple layers) |
| Input | Keyboard + Mouse |

## How do I build and run this?

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer recommended) with `npm`

### 1. Clone the repository

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run start-local
```

This runs Webpack in watch mode and spins up a local HTTP server in parallel.  
Open your browser at **http://localhost:8080** to play.

### 4. Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimised bundle is written to `public/js/game.js`. Serve the `public/` folder with any static file server.

## How do I play this?

1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Move your player to intercept the ball and kick it into the CPU's goal.
3. First player to reach 10 goals wins!

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` `←` `→` | Move player |
| `SPACE` | Shot |
